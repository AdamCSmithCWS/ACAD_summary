# Code to generate the summary histogram plots of the updated Avian Conservation Assessment Database (ACAD)

Currently just one script that outputs some draft pdfs to summarise the conservation assessments for groups of species. Produces plots like the one below showing the number of species in each assessment category for major breeding habitat categories, sorted based on the mean category across all species in the group. The colour scale reflects the risk categories, where higher assessment scores are in warmer colours (oranges and reds) and indicate high conservation risk. The palette should be interpretable for all [variations of colour-vision](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=RdYlBu&n=11).

![Histograms showing the distribution of maximum conservation risk scores for species in 13 major breeding habitats. The habitat groupings are sorted top to bottom based on the mean risk scores. Open country habitat species are generally at lower risk (top of the plot) than species in aridlands, grasslands, coasts, and islands.](primary_breeding_habitat_ccsmax_summary.png)
